Q2: remove any duplicate letter in a string
e.g: abcdefacf -> abcdef; aabcdd -> abcd
approach 1:
loop every letter, if occured again after initial, replace with blank
approach 2:
loop every letter, if it is the first occurence, copy to a new string, after the loop, new string should contain unique letters only, in correct order
