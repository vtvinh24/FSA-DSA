Q5: sequence of colors
is full if:
+ R = G
+ Y = B
+ prefix: R - G <= 1
+ prefix: Y - B <= 1

provided cases:
RGGR 1
RYBG 1
RYRB 0 (R != G)
YGYGRBRB 0 (prefix: YGY -> Y - B = 2)

assume:
GGRR 0 (prefix)
GRGR 1
RRGG 0 (prefix, same as first assume)

appr.1:
1. count each color, validate first 2 conditions
if fail -> 0
2. validate prefix:
for i = 1 to length of string
if violates 3rd or 4th rule -> 0
else 1
