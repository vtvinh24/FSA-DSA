input format:
t: number of test cases
-- each tc:
n: length of first linked list
n lines: n integers of first LL
m: length of second LL
m lines: m ints of second LL

sample input: (indentation is to make it easier to distinguish, actual input does not contain indents)
1
3
  1 
  2 
  3 
2
  3
  4

sample output:
1 2 3 3 4 

approach:
1. outer loop: test case
  for each tc:
    2. parse first LL: length, then elements
    3. parse second LL
    -- merge logic:
    4. inner loop:
      4.1. create new LL, start with smallest node of two LL
      4.2. loop both LL, append the smallest node to new LL
      4.3. for each append, point to next node of the selected LL
      4.4. go to 4.2
